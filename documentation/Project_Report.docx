Library Management System - Project Report
1. Executive SummaryL
The Library Management System (LMS) is a robust, full-stack web application designed to streamline the operations of a modern library. It facilitates the efficient management of books, members, and borrowing transactions. The system replaces manual record-keeping with a digital, automated solution that ensures data integrity, real-time availability tracking, and a seamless user experience.

2. Objectives
Digitization: Convert physical records of books and members into a persistent digital database.
Automation: Automate the borrowing and returning process, including date tracking and quantity adjustments.
Usability: Provide a clean, modern, and responsive user interface for library staff.
Reliability: Ensure data persistence across system restarts and prevent data corruption.
3. Technology Stack
The project is built using industry-standard technologies ensuring scalability and maintainability:

Backend
Framework: Spring Boot 3.4.12 (Java 17)
Build Tool: Maven
Database: H2 Database (File-based persistence with AUTO_SERVER mode)
ORM: Hibernate / Spring Data JPA
API: RESTful Web Services
Frontend
Framework: React 18
Build Tool: Vite
Styling: Pure CSS (Modern Variables, Flexbox/Grid, Glassmorphism)
HTTP Client: Axios
Icons: Lucide React
4. Key Features
📚 Book Management
Inventory Tracking: Manage multiple copies of the same book (Total Copies vs Available Copies).
Metadata: Track Title, Author, ISBN, and Published Date.
Status Indicators: Real-time "Available", "Out of Stock", or "Unavailable" badges.
CRUD Operations: Add, Edit, and Delete books seamlessy.
👥 Member Management
Registration: Register new members with Name, Email, and unique Library ID.
History: View borrowing history and currently held books for each member.
Management: Edit member details or remove members from the system.
🔄 Borrowing System
Check-out: Borrow books only if copies are available. Automatically decrements inventory.
Check-in (Return): Return books by Member ID to ensure the correct loan is closed. Automatically increments inventory.
Due Dates: Automatic calculation of due dates (default: 14 days) and display of borrow periods (e.g., 2023-10-01 → 2023-10-15).
5. System Architecture
The application follows a standard Client-Server Architecture:

Client (Frontend): A Single Page Application (SPA) served by Vite. It consumes JSON APIs exposed by the backend to fetch data and render the UI.
Server (Backend): A Spring Boot application that handles business logic, validation, and database interactions.
Database: An embedded H2 database running in file mode (./librarydb) to store data permanently on the disk.
